## STORY SUMMARY

Elias Crowhurst receives a mysterious letter sealed in black wax, claiming his late father's name is tied to a "legacy in Gravenmoor." When he arrives at the fog-shrouded city, he discovers he cannot leave - every road loops back to the city center. 

As he investigates the supernatural imprisonment, Elias uncovers the history of the Cult of Black Feathers and learns that his family bloodline is cursed to serve as guardians of the city. Through encounters with the ghostly Aurelia and the revelation that the cult leader is his own father's spirit, Elias must choose between escape and accepting his role as the eternal Ashen Warden, protecting future generations from the cult's power.
