### Example Structure:
*"The cathedral loomed before him, its twin spires piercing the gray veil of fog like accusing fingers. Gargoyles perched along the roofline, their stone faces twisted in expressions of eternal anguish, while heavy iron chains bound the great oak doors as if to keep something in rather than others out. Elias felt the weight of centuries pressing down upon him, the very stones seeming to whisper of secrets too terrible for the living world."*
